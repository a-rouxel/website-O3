        <h1>O3 Concepts</h1>
        <p>
          Key terminology and concepts used in orbital operations orchestration,
          from mission planning to execution monitoring.

    <section class="card reveal">
      <h2>Orbital Operations</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Operations performed by spacecraft in orbit, including maneuvers, observations,
        communications, and maintenance activities. Each operation has temporal, resource,
        and constraint requirements that must be satisfied.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card reveal">
      <h2>Orchestration</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The coordination of multiple operations across time and resources to achieve
        mission objectives while respecting physical, temporal, and operational constraints.
        Orchestration involves planning, scheduling, and real-time execution management.
      </p>

      <h2>Constraint Satisfaction</h2>

        <div class="col-6">
          <h3 style="margin:0 0 6px; font-size:16px">Temporal Constraints</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
            Time windows, deadlines, and sequencing requirements that operations must satisfy.
            Examples include launch windows, communication windows, and observation opportunities.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <h3 style="margin:0 0 6px; font-size:16px">Resource Constraints</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
            Limitations on power, fuel, data storage, and other consumables that affect
            which operations can be performed and when.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <h3 style="margin:0 0 6px; font-size:16px">Physical Constraints</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
            Orbital mechanics, pointing requirements, and hardware limitations that
            determine feasible operation sequences.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <h3 style="margin:0 0 6px; font-size:16px">Operational Constraints</h3>
          <p class="muted" style="margin:0">
            Mission rules, safety protocols, and operational procedures that must be
            followed during execution.
          </p>

    <section class="card reveal">
      <h2>Mission Planning</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The process of determining what operations need to be performed to achieve
        mission objectives. Planning considers long-term goals, available resources,
        and environmental factors to generate operation sequences.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="card reveal">
      <h2>Operation Scheduling</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        The assignment of specific times and resources to planned operations.
        Scheduling resolves conflicts, optimizes resource utilization, and ensures
        all constraints are satisfied while maximizing mission value.
